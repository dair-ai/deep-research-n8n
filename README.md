# Multi-Agent Deep Research System

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-agent deep research system built with Replit (front-end) and n8n (backend).

## Setting up the project

Step 1: You will need to have your n8n workflow already set up and active. We provide the deep research n8n template to our [academy members](https://dair-ai.thinkific.com/). If you are not part of the academy, you will need to create your workflow to hook up to this app. 

Step 2: Clone this project into Replit. Configure a secret key inside of Replit for the webhook URL like this: `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`. Include your n8n webhook test or production URL.

Step 3: Run your project to test that the Replit app can connect to the n8n workflow. 

Step 4: Deploy your application.
